			<h1>Experiment 2 - Vector Art, Animation & Interactivity</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started this experiment by browsing through examples, and came across one of scaling squares based on the mouse position. While imitating this design, I tested out modifying the shapes and colors to see how the overall design would change. Initially, I changed the squares to circles, and the outline of each shape to green.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>Continuing from the previous step, I wanted to work more with the coloring of the image. I began by filling in each shape with a shade of blue, while also making each filling somewhat transparent so that the outline of the circles could still be seen. Then I added in a dark blue background to fit alongside the updated blue circles. My intention was to create an image that resembled the ocean because of how the shapes flowed easily in their size.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Working with shifting the colors of the image, I had an idea to shift them more from the blue I had already selected. I wanted to implement a feature where the user could use their mouse to alternate the colors. While I was able to get this functionality to work, I wanted this method to feel more intuitive to the user. Instead, I opted to remove the mouse functionality and simply have the colors shift by dragging the mouse to a new position. Once I added this, I also incorporated the ability for the background to shift colors too.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Based on where my current skill set is at for working in JavaScript and p5.js, I feel satisfied with where my final design ended up. In the future, I would like to work more on understanding mouse controls and shifting between colors so that I may incorpate furthre color techniques into my design and or future experiments.</p>
