				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I began this experiment by sampling an Autumn tree created using L-systems, which also had varying colored branches included in the design. For this step, I took my knowledge for altering colors to shift the branches and background for an overall forest theme. The example I chose used HSB instead of RGB for selecting the colors, which I was unfamiliar with. After some quick research, I was able to understand how to generate my desired colors using this new color scale.</p>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>The entire structure of the tree was created using L-systems. This was a new concept for me going into this project. My goal was the change the structure of the tree into my own unique style. At this point, I tested out changing characters im the string used to generate the tree. I got varying results, until I was able to acquire a form I was satisfied with for the time being.</p>

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>In between working sessions, I had a new idea to alter my theme from a verdant forest, to a Summer sunset. I wanted to implement a color gradient for the backgroun, to symbolise the colors of a sunset. I researched into gradient backgrounds online, and came across one sketch I could use as an example. I then implemented my two selected colors to shift between; while this worked, it was not to my desired result. The issue was that my colors shifted through the wrong selection of colors instead of the direction I preferred. I first attempted to change the overall color settings back to RGB. This resolved my issue with the background, but also altered the tree itself since it was originally made using HSB. My soltion to this problem was to shift to RGB for generating the background, then to HSB for the tree itself. Finally, I did more research into L-systems to generate a structure for the tree I was more satisfied with, mostly filling it out with more leaves and branches.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I am pleased with how my final design turned out. While it is a bit simplistic, I still enjoyed going about its creation, learning about L-systems and color gradients along the way. Considering the concept of L-systems was new to me, and still complex overall, I feel that this is well reflected in my final design.</p>
