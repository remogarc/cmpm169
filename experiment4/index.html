			<h1>Experiment 4 - Images, Video, & Sound Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>When looking through various examples, I became fascinated by a project shown during lecture. In this project, there is an animated design made up of different shapes. Upon user interactivity, the design will begin to play music, with some shapes changing in size by reacting to the given audio. This inspired me to create a design based on Super Mario Galaxy, one of my favorite video games. In particular, I wanted to base my design off of a specific segment from that game, Gusty Garden. I first began by downloading this song from YouTube and adding it into my version of the design, making sure to test it out.</p>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>Once I implemented my own song into the project, I began altering the colors of the base design to reflect my inspiration. By reading through the sample, I determined where each shape was being generated along with the methods used to create them. From there, I was able to alter different shapes with my desired colors by selecting them from an image of Gusty Garden and then providing into the design. For each shape, I wanted to represent a different aspect of the original game, including green for the terrain, yellow for coins and stars, an assortment of lighter colors for smaller flowers, pink for larger flowers, and blue mixed with white for the background and clouds.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Following my newly colored design, I decided to look more into the generation of each shape. The original sample used custom methods for creating a symmetrical series of shapes, circling around the center. For my design, I changed various shapes into others. In addition, I overlapped some shapes on the same location as others to give the illusion of an entirely new shape, complete with animations. Using this idea, I expanded my design by adding two outer rings of ellipses stacked on top of each other, but with alternating radius values. This gave the illusion of objects flashing and floating in the air, representing coins from my source.</p>
				<p>When my design was visually complete, I went back to the audio aspect of it. For this part, I added in four more songs from Super Mario Galaxy to make a total of five. Using the keyboard and mouse functionalities, I added support for the user to cycle between songs, similar to a radio. In addition I used the 1-5 keys to allow the user to select a song out of the predetermined order. Otherwise the songs will simply loop through upon interaction.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was an experiment I enjoyed working on a lot, since I was able to reminisce about some of my favorite memories playing Super Mario Galaxy. This was also my first time extensively working on audio design, in which I feel more comfortable working with already established audio rather than understanding my own. I was also able to learn more about generative shapes and patterns using my chosen sample. In the future, I would like to learn more about this area, as to continue developing my skills, where I may implement custom shapes that share the same result.</p>
