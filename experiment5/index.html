			<h1>Experiment 5 - 3D Graphics</h1>

				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started this experiment with no idea in mind. Instead I decided to browse various examples online until I found one I would like to reference. One example I came across was a series of generative chunks which would rotate around the screen and shift colors between them and the background.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>The first area I focused on was understanding the different uses of color in the sample. Once I did this, I was able to reflect the design using different colors of my choice, where the design would shift between these colors. Moving on to the chunks themselves, I read through the code to understand the methods used in the example. I started by changing the rotation values of each direction. Then, I modified the vertices of each chunk when rendered on the screen so that they would appear with a different structure from the sample. From here, I returned to the rotation properties, now changing the translation values instead. This segment would affect the direction each chunk moves when the design is in motion. I ended up coming across a result in which the chunks gave the illusion of orbiting around the center, which became my inspiration for enhancing the design.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>When it came to this step, my idea was to contain all the chunks within a large sphere to give the appearence of energy swirling inside a core. After accomplishing this, I looked into adding textures into my design. First, I added a simple texture to the chunks, followed by the sphere. However, the sphere did not apply the way I initially wanted, since it covered up the chunks. I experimented more with the sphere a little more, before converting it to another shape entirely. Now as a torus, I felt that it fit the theme of a design featuring orbiting objects. To complete my design, I added in more shapes to orbit around the chunks, applying textures to them as well and making each one a different size with their own rotations.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>In the past, I have not worked on much in terms of 3D graphics so this was my first time learning a lot more about them. In my experiment, I was given a small introduction to lighting, shaders, and textures, which I would like to continue studying in the future. Additionly, I appreciate how my design was able to turn out given my background on the subject. While I did not have an initial idea, I was able to come up with a theme by the end, which is well illustrated in the final design.</p>
