			<h1>Experiment 6 - Grammars & Text Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<P>When I started this experiment, I found one example that had a rotating cylinder which was given text as a texture. In addition to this, the top and bottom half of the cylinder were taken out so that it appeared as a tunnel of text. Seeing this sample inspired me to create a design resembling a portal. Specifically from the Pok√©mon Sun and Moon games, there is a type of portal called an Ultra Wormhole. The aspect I was inspired by included how these portals have an opaque center with colors swirling around the entry point.</P>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<P>The first notable change I made to the sample involved editing the text. I used different characters such as "^" and slashes to give the illusion of a gravitaional force pulling inward. Working more on what I gathered from my inspiration, I modified a boolen value of the rectangle so that one end was visible to look like the inside of a portal. I also amplified the portal effect by adding an additional cylinder to rotate the opposite direction. Although, one issue I came acorss was that the text texture of one with clip through that of the other. To fix this issue, I scaled down the radius of one cylinder, improving this effect significantly.</P>
				<p>I decided to revist my implementation of the second cylinder. This time, I instead changed it to a cone. Now, this version reflected a pull towards the center of the first cylinder by directing the text to a specific point. I felt satisfied by this change because it further embraced by original inspiration.</p>

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<P>At this point, I was unsure as to where I should move to next with my design. I ended up going to earlier sections of the sample to determine where I wanted to experiment with next. One area I examined was moving the background fill from draw() to setup(). The result of this made it so the text would become permanent on screen with each rotation cycle. Fascinated by this appearence, I decided to implement this with my project. Moreover, the user could scroll in and out of the design using orbitControl() to create a new design altogether.</P>
				<p>Next, I added in more support for the user, incorporating keyboard inputs. I used "c" to clear the users current drawing state, then "z" and "x" to change between HSB and RGB color scales respectively. Interestingly, I discovered that by changing to RGB, the colors were primarily a shade of blue and white. Also, by scrolling the design to fill in colors of the portal, it strongly resembled my inspiration from the Ultra Wormholes. Intrigued by this, I appreciated how my design was able to come full circle so I decided to keep this implementation.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<P>I enjoyed working more with 3D graphics for this experiment by focusing on the use of text to create unique imagery. While my design feels simple in some approach, I am still satisfied with how it was able to resemble my original inspiration in the end. This experiment also gave me more insight to specifics of 3D graphics such as textures and rotation, which I hope to continue learning about as to apply to future projects.</P>
