			<h1>Experiment 7 - Data Visualization & Networks</h1>

				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started this experiment by browsing tutorials online for visualizing data in p5.js. I came across a few examples on YouTube, which I used as my base design. I also referenced a tutorial for using and creating csv files to import a set of data. In my design, I attempted to replicate data visualized by circles of different sizes. Additionally, the data I chose to represent was a poll from 2020 to determine the popularity of the top 30 Pokémon.</p>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>Once I was able to replicate the example I chose, I moved on to recording the data using the official Pokémon website to tally results. For each species, I also provided a matching color in a separate column in the csv file by converting RGB values onlines. Next, I adjusted parts of my design, including the coordiates of each circle and the placement and size of the text.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Currently, all the circles would be placed on top of one another, which made it difficult to see different names. While searching for a resolution, I found one example that used an alogrithm to place circles on a canvas without overlap. Thus, I chose to implement this alogrithm into my own project, including adjustments where necessary. Finally, I worked more on the visual aspects of the design, by adding in a gradient background, similar to Experiment 3, and also including text for the amount of votes each Pokémon received.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>While my design feels simple, I enjoyed working with data I feel familiar with and fond of. In addition, most of my time spent on this experiment was in regards to learning how to use and make csv files, as well as understand how to use them. I appreciate this because it not only allows me to visuallize data, but I was also able to learn how to record my own data as well, where it can then be redistributed online.</p>
